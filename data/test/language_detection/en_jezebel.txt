Long before Hollywood began to piss us off with their countless, uninspired reboots, rumors of both a remake and a sequel to The Goonies had been swirling around for years. Director Richard Donner squashed hopes of a sequel in a recent interview with Uproxx. “Maybe,” was his response. “Again, everything takes a long time to get it right. If you do things fast and quick and easy, that’s a disservice. But if there were going to be another movie it would take us a long time to get it right, because we have a lot of history that we’re involved with and a lot of integrity that we have to keep to what once was, and lives a life of its own without destroying it. Maybe the powers that be are working on something.”

There is some good news, however. Donner is working on an off-Broadway, immersive theater version of the 1985 film. Similar to experimental theater such as Sleep No More, this modern Goonies experience would be an interactive setting that allows the fourth wall to be broken. Donner says the production will take place in a warehouse venue without seating, where the audience becomes a part of gang and gets to “travel through with actors.” He says it will take at least another year, “but it’s going to be wonderful.”

This sounds like my childhood fantasy come true.
