Donald Trump isn't one to share the spotlight, but on Tuesday night, he made an exception for the former Alaska governor and John McCain's 2008 vice presidential running mate.

Palin appeared alongside Trump at a raucous campaign rally, following days of speculation about the identity of a "special guest."

In front of thousands of Trump fans, Palin handed Trump his most high-profile endorsement yet, just two weeks out from the Iowa caucuses.

"Heads are spinnin'. Media heads are spinning! This is going to be so much fun!" Palin yelled from the stage. "Are you ready to make America great again?"

Palin's at times disjointed 20-minute speech was filled with Palinisms like "pussy-footin'," "hallelujah" and "you betcha." With Trump looking on from beside her, she hailed the real estate developer as a "compassionate," "refreshing" and "self-made" man who would bring the country back from President Barack Obama's disastrous tenure.
