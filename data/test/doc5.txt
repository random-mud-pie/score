Actress and Fox News contributor Stacey Dash appeared on Outnumbered to discuss recent news regarding the potential Oscars boycott. “I think it’s ludicrous,” said Dash. “We have to make up our minds. Either we want to have segregation or integration, and if we don’t want segregation, then we have to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards, where you’re only awarded if you’re black.” This is the moment when Dash burned her BET bridges—the actress had once appeared on the network’s series, The Game.

According to US Weekly, BET responded to Dash’s comments through their social media channels. On Instagram, BET posted a still from The Game featuring Dash with the caption, “Soooooo @realstaceyldash, can we get our check back... or nah? #Remember #YouWereOnTheGame #AndWeDontMeanTheRapper.” They also tweeted a link to a post on their website titled, “Every Time Stacey Dash Proved She Was Clueless.”

Dash also wants to get rid of Black History Month. “There shouldn’t be a Black History Month. You know? We’re Americans. Period. That’s it,” Dash said. Host Steve Doocy then asked, “Are you saying there shouldn’t be a Black History Month because there isn’t a white history month?” Dash replied, “Exactly. Exactly.”

Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett-Smith both announced they would not be attending next month’s Oscar ceremony due to its all-white list of nominees. Janet Hubert, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’s original Aunt Viv also recently spoke out against the boycott, but her reasons were due to beef with former co-star Will Smith.

Since Stacey Dash will probably never be seen on a BET show ever again, she can just start going for more Lifetime Movie roles. It was just a few months ago when I saw her play a receptionist on the movie, Patient Killer.
